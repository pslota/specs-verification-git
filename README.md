## SPECS verification

This is the official repository of forecast verification routines for the SPECS FP7 project.

### Now available on CRAN

As of 2 May 2014, the package `SpecsVerification` is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network ([CRAN](http://cran.R-project.org)). This means it can be installed from R by

    install.packages("SpecsVerification")

It is still under development and will see some changes in the future, but the main bugs have been fixed. If you want to get emails if new versions of `SpecsVerification` become available, write an email to `s.siegert (at) exeter (dot) ac (dot) uk`.
    

### Manual download, install, load

These instructions show you how to install the latest version of the `SpecsVerification` package from github. Modifications will first appear on this repository before they are submitted to CRAN.

**Download** the master branch of this repository to `/tmp`. In the Linux shell, do

    cd /tmp
    wget "https://github.com/sieste/specs-verification-git/archive/master.zip"
    unzip master.zip

Mac and Windows users click on the `Download ZIP` link on the right of this page and save to a temporary directory. Extract the zip archive to the temporary directory using your favourite file extraction tool.

**Install** the package from source. Open a `R` session and enter the command

    install.packages("/tmp/specs-verification-git-master", repo=NULL, lib="/tmp", type="source")
    
Replace the `/tmp` directory as necessary. Omitting the `lib="/tmp"` will install to your default library directory, which you probably do not want at the present stage of development. In order to install the current development branch, simply replace `master` by `develop` in all the above commands.

To **load** the package from the library directory `/tmp`, and list all its functions, do

    library("SpecsVerification", lib.loc="/tmp")
    ls("package:SpecsVerification")
